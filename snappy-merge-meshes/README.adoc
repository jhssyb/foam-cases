The idea of the cases is to illustrate mesh merge process. Starting point is
geometry shown on Fig. 1:

.Initial geometry
[caption="Figure 1: "]

It is created in `OpenSCAD` (script is link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrklein/foam-cases/master/snappy-merge-meshes/strange-tube/strange-tube.scad[here]). Final aim is to
generate mesh for the geometry and to attach cuboid inlet and outlet blocks,
like on the Fig. 2:

To generate mesh run `Prepare` script in `strange-tube` folder.

Case is tested on OpenFOAM(R) 4.0.
