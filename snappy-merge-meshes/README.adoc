= snappy-merge-meshes

The idea of the cases is to illustrate mesh merge process. Starting point is
geometry shown on Fig. 1:

.Initial geometry
[caption="Figure 1: "]
image::http://...strange-tube.png[Initial geometry]

It is created in `OpenSCAD` (script is link:http://...[here]). Final aim is to
generate mesh for the geometry and to attach cuboid inlet and outlet blocks,
like on the Fig. 2:

.Final geometry

To generate mesh run `Prepare` script in `strange-tube` folder.

Case is tested on OpenFOAM(R) 4.0.
