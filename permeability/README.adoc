= permeability

Different cases to demonstrate a way to check when transient simulations reach
steady state.

Each case has `Prepare`, `Run`, `Stop`, and `Clean` scripts to simplify case
manipulations.

All plotting scripts use link:http://matplotlib.org[matplotlib] and
link:http://numpy.org[numpy].

== square-tube-pressure-loss

Transient simulation of a flow through the pipe with square profile. Flow rate
is set using inlet velocity. Pressure drop (since at the outlet pressure is
zero, in fact, just average pressure at the inlet is used) is used as a value
to monitor state of simulation. On the plot pressure loss is compared with
one estimated using Darcy-Weisbach equation.

`plot-pressure-loss.py` plots comparison of simulated pressure loss with value
calculated using Dracy-Weisbach equation.

== square-tube-flow-rate

The same as `square-tube-pressure-loss` but instead of flow rate, pressure drop
is fixed. Flow rate is used to monitor state of simulation. On the plot
comparison with Darcy-Weisbach is shown.

`plot-inlet-velocity.py` plots comparison of simulated volume-averaged velocity
with value calculated with Darcy-Weisbach equation.

== cylinder-array-in-square-tube

Transient simulation of the flow in square tube through an array of
perpendicular cylinders.

Constant pressure difference at the inlet and outlet
is set. Permeability of the channel, estimated from Darcy's law, using volume
averaged velocity, is used to monitor state of the simulation.

`gen-cylinders.py` script generates `cylinders` file with `searchableCylinder`
descriptions, which then included into `snappyHexMeshDict`.

`plot-permeability.py` plots channel permeability calculated with Darcy's law.

`plot-permeability.gp` plots channel permeability with `gnuplot`.
