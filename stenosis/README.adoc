Case was create in response to this quiestion: https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-meshing-open/185959-gmshtofoam-3d-instead-2d.html.

To run the case, you:

1. Decide what symmetry you need (plane and axial).
2. Run `Prepare` script with corresponding options (ex. `./Prepare axial`).
3. Run `simpleFoam`.
4. Wait for convergence.

`figs` folder contains two pictures with velocity field for different symmetry
cases.
